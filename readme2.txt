This project explores the ethical principles of AI such as fairness, privacy, robustness, and explainability through a practical implementation in Python.

✅ Steps Performed
Bias Detection:
- Identified potential bias in dataset features using correlation heatmaps and target distribution analysis.

Privacy-Aware Handling:
- Ensured no personally identifiable information (PII) was exposed.
- Simulated safe handling by anonymizing sensitive fields.

Fairness Evaluation:
- Used group-wise accuracy and confusion matrix to assess fairness across demographic categories.

Model Explainability:
- Applied feature importance using scikit-learn models and visualized with bar plots.

Robustness Check:
- Tested model consistency with noisy and imbalanced data scenarios.

🎯 Result  
Implemented an ethically aligned machine learning pipeline with fairness checks, privacy precautions, and explainability insights.

🛠️ Tools Used  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
